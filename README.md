# NOEMS_posting_locations
This repository contains the code used to optimize EMS posting locations.

In an effort to promote faster, more reliable, and more equitable response times to health-related 911 calls in the face of demand for its services, New Orleans Emergency Medical Services (NOEMS) worked with OPA to develop a new, data-driven ambulance placement protocol.  In partnership with LSU analytics graduate students, OPA developed an optimization algorithm that ranked locations by potential impact, incorporating daily and weekly patterns in traffic, 911 calls, and ambulance availability.  The result was a prioritized list of locations to place ambulances during day shifts (assuming high traffic and daytime 911 call patterns) and the night shifts (assuming low traffic and nighttime 911 call patterns, which concentrate in the French Quarter and Central Business District).

 

Analysis of 911 data shows that since the new protocol was implemented, there are more equitable response times across districts, with the largest gains (15%) in the proportion of calls within response times standards (12 minutes) coming in the 4th district (West Bank), the area of the city with the historically slowest response times. Response time compliance in the 7th district (New Orleans East), a district with historically slower response times, also improved substantially (9%).  In addition, the new protocol led to modest, statistically significant improvements in citywide response times during the night shifts. During the day shifts, there were no overall statistically significant improvements in response times. However, equity in response times across districts improved.
